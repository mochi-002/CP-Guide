# Dynamic Programming Fundamentals

## What is DP?
A method to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions.

## Two Approaches
### 1. Memoization (Top-down)
- Recursive with caching
- Evaluates only needed subproblems

### 2. Tabulation (Bottom-up)
- Iterative table filling
- Evaluates all subproblems up to target

## When to Use DP?
- **Optimal Substructure**: Solution can be built from subproblems
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblem appears multiple times

## Common Applications
- Fibonacci sequence
- Knapsack problem
- Longest common subsequence
- Matrix chain multiplication
