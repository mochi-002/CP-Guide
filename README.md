## üö¶ Quick Start

1. **During contests**:
   ```bash
   # Find needed snippet fast (VS Code/CLion)
   Ctrl+Shift+F "lattice points"
   ```
2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   // In your template:
   #include "local/path/2 :: CP QuickFunes.md"
   ```
1. **üí° Pro Tips**:
   ```bash
   // Bookmark these combos:
   #define MATH_CRUNCH "3 :: CP Math.md + 2 :: CP QuickFunes.md"
   #define SPEED_BOOST "4 :: CP Tips & Tricks.md ‚Üí I/O optimization"
   ```

## üåü Why This Works
### 0.1s Access - Numbered files = faster navigation
### Copy-Paste Ready - No adaption needed
### Cross-Referenced - "See also" links between files

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance
```cpp
# To keep files synced:
1. git pull origin main
2. Add new tricks in correct numbered file
3. git commit -m "feat: Add Fenwick tree tricks to (2)"
```

## FAQ
### How do I get started?
```cpp
Clone this repository and familiarize yourself with the file structure. The numbered files make it easy to navigate and find what you need during competitions.
```
### How should I use this during contests?
```cpp
Use search functionality (Ctrl+Shift+F) to quickly find algorithms or techniques you need. The numbering system helps you know exactly where to look for specific types of solutions.
```
### Can I contribute?
```cpp
Absolutely! Feel free to submit PRs with new algorithms, optimizations, or fixes. Just make sure to add them to the appropriate numbered file.
```
### How do I customize this for my workflow?
```cpp
You can modify the template and quick functions to match your coding style. Just maintain the numbered file structure for easy navigation.
