## 🔰 1. Master the Basics

### 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms
```plaintext
- Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching
- Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
- Recursion, Backtracking
- Hashing, Heaps, Priority Queues
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST)
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
```

### ➗ Essential Math
```plaintext
- Number Theory (Primes, GCD, LCM, Modulo)
- Combinatorics (Permutations, Combinations)
- Bit Manipulation
```

## ⚡ 2. Speed & Accuracy

### 🏎️ Fast Coding Tips
```plaintext
+ Use Vim/VS Code with snippets
+ Pre-written templates for common patterns
+ Master keyboard shortcuts
```

### 🎯 Accuracy Checklist
```plaintext
- Always check constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 1e5?)
- Test edge cases:
  * N=0, N=1
  * Large inputs
  * Corner cases
```

## 🧠 3. Problem-Solving Strategy

### graph TD
```plaintext
- A[Read Problem] --> B[Understand Constraints]
- B --> C[Brute Force Idea]
- C --> D[Optimization]
- D --> E[Complexity Check]
- E --> F[Implementation]
```

## 📈 4. Practice Smartly

### 🎯 Difficulty Progression
```plaintext
- Beginner     → 100+ easy problems
- Intermediate → Codeforces Div2 C/D (1700+)
- Advanced     → Segment Trees, Advanced DP
```

### 📝 Progress Tracking
```plaintext
# Recommended Tools
- Notion/Excel for problem logs
- Git for code versioning
- Codeforces Solve Tracker
```

## 🏆 5. Contest Participation

### 📉 Post-Contest Routine
```plaintext
- Upsolve unsolved problems
- Read editorials
- Analyze top submissions
```

## 💻 6. Development Setup

### 🔧 Recommended Tools
```plaintext
IDE: VS Code with:
  - Competitive Companion
  - C++ Snippets
  - FastOlympicCoding plugin
```

### 📜 Must-Have Snippets
```plaintext
// Fast I/O
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);

// Modular Arithmetic
const int MOD = 1e9+7;
```

## 🔥 7. Staying Motivated

### 💪 Mindset Tips
```plaintext
"Rating is just a number. Focus on learning." - tourist
✅ Daily practice (1-2 problems)
✅ Learn from mistakes
✅ Follow top coders
```
